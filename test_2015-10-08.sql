I can\'t abide wasting time, short term thinking or being busy just for the sake of it. Being a parent teaches you that time is precious. However while people are getting on with the job there is still time for plenty of ?good craic?.

	(3,'Belbin 1.0 has lift off','Peter Wilkins','## Oh where oh where has my $true_Love gone?\n\nTo my amazement, we have built a functional web application after only 2 days. Following the Scrum principle of Minimum viable product, we have taken \'our\' shortest route to a product we can show our client and get feedback on.\n\n![Our Belbin app\'s home page](belbin.jpg)\n\nThe challenge was to digitize the [Belbin Team Roles Test](http://belbin.com) that we all completed on paper during the interview process for the Academy. It\'s an interesting problem because the process of adding up the scores is quite convoluted - the answers have been randomly mixed in terms of the team roles to which they relate.\n\nI dived into this problem that evening. Luckily I had previously seen a similar problem solved using a lookup table, plus there had been mention of something called arrays a few dozen times from Charlie and Connor. I also had to made up placeholder names of a few functions in PHP as I don\'t have broadband at home yet.\n\n\n\nNext morning I found the correct function names, sorted the typos and got some code to run, but not with the results I wanted. I was encouraged by the fact that Luke had come up with a similar solution (albeit one more intuitive to write and easier to read). However my solution stubbornly refused to work as it should.\n\nThe matrix of Belbin role codes:\n\n		<?php\n		//  lookup table for belbin scores\n		 $BELBIN_CODES = array(\n	     		array(\"RI\", \"TW\", \"PL\", \"CO\", \"CF\", \"SP\", \"SH\", \"IM\", \"ME\"),\n	      		array(\"IM\", \"CO\", \"SP\", \"RI\", \"ME\", \"SH\", \"TW\", \"PL\", \"CF\"),\n	      		array(\"CO\", \"CF\", \"SH\", \"PL\", \"TW\", \"RI\", \"CF\", \"ME\", \"IM\"),\n	      		array(\"TW\", \"SP\", \"SH\", \"ME\", \"IM\", \"PL\", \"CF\", \"RI\", \"CO\"),\n	       		array(\"ME\", \"IM\", \"TW\", \"SH\", \"RI\", \"CO\", \"CF\", \"PL\", \"SP\"),\n	       		array(\"SP\", \"PL\", \"TW\", \"CO\", \"CF\", \"ME\", \"IM\", \"SH\", \"RI\"),\n			array(\"SH\", \"ME\", \"CF\", \"RI\", \"IM\", \"PL\", \"CO\", \"SP\", \"TW\"));\n\nAn array of arrays of test scores:\n\n		<?php\n		// matrix of test scores\n		$test_scores = array(\n	 		array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0),\n			array(0,0,0,3,5,0,0,2,0));\n	\nNext I call my function and echo the results and what they should be but I don\'t get the results I expect....\n\n		<?php\n		$result = add_up_scores($test_scores);\n\n		echo \"SH should be  5. SH = \" . $result[\'SH\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"CF should be 10. CF = \" . $result[\'CF\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"IM should be 12. IM = \" . $result[\'IM\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"CO should be  6. CO = \" . $result[\'CO\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"RI should be 13. RI = \" . $result[\'RI\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"TW should be  5. TW = \" . $result[\'TW\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"PL should be  7. PL = \" . $result[\'PL\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"ME should be 10. ME = \" . $result[\'ME\'] . \"<br />\";\n		echo \"SP should be  2. SP = \" . $result[\'SP\'] . \"<br />\";\n	\nHere are the disappointing results:\n	\n	SH should be 5. SH = 0\n	CF should be 10. CF = 0\n	IM should be 12. IM = 0\n	CO should be 6. CO = 0\n	RI should be 13. RI = 0\n	TW should be 5. TW = 0\n	PL should be 7. PL = 0\n	ME should be 10. ME = 0\n	SP should be 2. SP = 0\n\nWhy do all the scores equal zero? whats going wrong? Answers on a postcard...\n\nIt turned out he problem was scope. The scope of a variable is the areas of a program where the variable can be accessed. I had written the main logic of my solution in a function so it could be called whenever needed but in PHP, functions can only see what you pass them in their brackets. I wasn\'t giving the function the lookup table arrays so it was giving me a blank result when I performed a lookup code.\n\nCalling the function, passing it the scores matrix and the Belbin roles matrix:\n\n		<?php\n		$result = add_up_scores($test_scores, $BELBIN_CODES);\n	\n...and we get the correct results, woohoo!\n\n	SH should be 5. SH = 5\n	CF should be 10. CF = 10\n	IM should be 12. IM = 12\n	CO should be 6. CO = 6\n	RI should be 13. RI = 13\n	TW should be 5. TW = 5\n	PL should be 7. PL = 7\n	ME should be 10. ME = 10\n	SP should be 2. SP = 2\n	\nA strongly typed language like Java would have saved me from my own ignorance, but PHP was happy to let me hang by my own petard. An important lesson learned, one that will not be forgotten quickly. I learned an incredible amount in the two days, mostly about how much there is to learn and how much fun that is going to be.\n\nI really enjoyed this project, it was impossible not to work on it every spare hour I had and I am brimming with ideas for Belbin 3.0 (2.0 was already canned due to it being fundamentally flawed). However, I should keep in mind that it\'s not about what I want. I\'ll have to see what the clients (in this case Mayden) want and plan the next version, if there is one, around that feedback.\n\nSome of my ideas include\n* put all the instructions, questions and results in an accordian then post all the scores to results.php. No database is required, which is good because are freeMysql account was deleted. We can offer to email the results to the user.\n* write the whole thing in javascript so now there is no need for a server. Export the results as a pdf.\nInteresting thought experiments but PHP, Javascript, Mysql and CSS have enabled us to produce something pretty good, very quickly.\n\nAnother scrum principle is self managing teams. At times I felt quite insecure that nothing would get done if there wasn\'t someone \'experienced\' managing things. Ok, Luke was keeping us on track so we didn\'t waste our time completely but I think he gave us enough freedom to say that this application is our own work. It was amazing how everyone in the team dived into what they thought they could do that would be useful and the results speak for themselves.\n\nI think Scrum\'s greatest challenge is accepting that uncertainty. The process was great to see in action, how the chaos (and it was chaotic at times) would build and then suddenly, magically, dispirit parts would join up and we would have a result. The energy in the group was exceptional, although on the last afternoon I did go bibbledy. In Scrum we trust, Amen.\n','php','To my amazement, we have built a functional web application after only 2 days.

	(4,'Lessons learned from Sprint 1','Peter Wilkins','###Scrambled data...\nWhen building the lookup tables I overcomplicated the process by changing the way the data was ordered while Luke simply copied the Belbin table into an array. I had to do a fair bit of mental arithmetic and made several errors in my handwritten work when building the test. Where possible the data structure should mirror the data.\n\n###School Boy Errors...\nWhen we \'designed\' the program we did not follow the guideline DRY: Don\'t repeat yourself. We built 7 separate pages that did roughly the same job with minor differences. We later realized that this made it difficult and buggy to change a feature across the seven pages so I had a stab at solving the problem....\n\nOn the other hand I had loads of trouble because I put my logic for adding up the scores into a function when it is only ever called once in the whole application. So another rule could be DOC: Don\'t over complicate.\n\n###Reinventing the wheel...\nWhen I tried to refactor the 7 question pages into one I again overcomplicated things. I hit a wall trying to rework the logical flow of the program when Marta had already done it perfectly. \'All\' I needed to do was replace references to a single question page with code that used used the $question_id to reference the question in the $QUESTIONS array.\n\n###Baby Steps...\nI also tried to change everything at once and got into a complete muddle that resulted in my brain blowing a fuse. Change one thing at a time - it seems obvious but when \'this\' is related to \'that\' there is the temptation to change it all at once. I realize refactoring someone else\'s code is a very different skill set to writing something from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n###Do\'s and Don\'ts\n\nDo:\n\n* Use loops/code to do the work if there are more than 3 similar elements. Don\'t repeat yourself.\n\n* Break up the code separate include files if the is a ggood reason such as keeping settings out of the code or to make the code more readable.\n\n* Put code that is used many times in a function [(just don\'t forget about scope!)](http://peter-wilkins-mayden.github.io/acblog/in-scrum-we-trust/).\n\n* If your stuck, explain your design or code to someone else.\n\n* Only change one thing at a time.\n\n* Write pseudo code / start by describing the problem in english\n\n* Write unit tests - small simple tests that check the code works.\n\nDon\'t\n\n* Scramble the data\n\n* Reinvent an existing structure / logic / program flow that already works.\n\n* Struggle on your own; ask for help on slack or forums (but ask a well formed question!) People love to help if they can. We are very lucky here that we can ask questions on Mayden\'s general channel and hopefully someone in the company will know the answer.\n','php','When we \'designed\' the program we did not follow the guideline DRY: Don\'t repeat yourself.
